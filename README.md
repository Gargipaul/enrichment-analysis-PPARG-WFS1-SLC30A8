# Functional Annotation and Pathway Enrichment of Type 2 Diabetes-associated SNPs

## Abstract

Type 2 Diabetes (T2D) is a complex metabolic disease influenced by genetic factors regulating insulin sensitivity and β-cell function. This project investigates the expression and statistical significance of three consistently associated T2D genes—**PPARG**, **WFS1**, and **SLC30A8**—using genome-wide significant single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from the DIAGRAM GWAS dataset. Functional annotation was performed using g:Profiler, and gene-level differential expression was visualized via volcano plots using Python. Notably, **PPARG** and **WFS1** showed strong upregulation (log₂ fold change > 2.5, p < 0.001), while **SLC30A8** showed a modest but borderline significant signal. This integrative analysis highlights potential therapeutic targets and demonstrates the power of visualization in genomic data interpretation.

## Data and Methods

### Data Source
- **GWAS Dataset**: DIAGRAMv3.2012DEC17 – genome-wide significant SNPs (p < 5×10⁻⁸)

### Functional Annotation
- Tool: [g:Profiler](https://biit.cs.ut.ee/gprofiler/)
- Output includes enriched gene ontologies and pathway annotations

### Genes of Interest
- **PPARG** – nuclear receptor affecting adipogenesis and insulin sensitivity
- **WFS1** – regulates ER stress and β-cell function
- **SLC30A8** – zinc transporter important for insulin granule formation

### Statistical Thresholds
- Significance: p < 0.05
- Visualization: Volcano plot with log₂ fold change (x-axis) vs. –log₁₀ p-value (y-axis)
